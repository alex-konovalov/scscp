<Heading>Examples of &SCSCP; usage</Heading>    

In this chapter we are going to demonstrate some examples of communication
between client and server using the SCSCP.

<Section Label="Writing">
<Heading>Providing Web services with the SCSCP package</Heading>

You can try to run the SCSCP server with the configuration file
<File>scscp/tst/myserver.g</File>. To do this, go to that directory
and enter <C>gap myserver.g</C>. After this you will see some diagnostic
messages and finally the server will be waiting for the connection. The
final part of the statrtup screen will look as follows:

<Example>
<![CDATA[
InstallSCSCPprocedure : procedure WS_factorial installed. 
InstallSCSCPprocedure : procedure GroupIdentificationService installed. 
InstallSCSCPprocedure : procedure IdGroup512ByCode installed. 
InstallSCSCPprocedure : procedure Disconnect installed. 
InstallSCSCPprocedure : procedure Terminate installed. 
Ready to accept TCP/IP connections at localhost:26133 ...
Waiting for new client connection at localhost:26133 ...
]]>
</Example>

Note that the procedure <C>IdGroup512ByCode</C> requires the &GAP;
package &ANUPQ;. Further comments are given in the file 
<File>scscp/tst/myserver.g</File> and they are self-explanatory.
<P/>

There also some test files in the directory <File>scscp/tst/</File>
supplied with detailed comments. First, you may use demonstration
files, preliminary loading the code for the demonstration mode as it is
explained in these files, or just executing step by step each command
from <File>scscp/tst/demo.g</File> and <File>scscp/tst/omdemo.g</File>.
Then you can try to use client's tools to access SCSCP services from 
files <File>scscp/tst/id512.g</File>, <File>scscp/tst/idperm.g</File> 
and <File>scscp/tst/factor.g</File>.
