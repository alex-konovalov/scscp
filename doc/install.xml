The &SCSCP; client for &GAP; is fully functional under &GAP; 4.4
and works in UNIX/Linux environments, Mac OS X (UNIX installation)
and MS Windows. 
<P/>

The &SCSCP; server for &GAP; is fully functional with the &GAP; 
development version and goes automatically into the compatibility 
mode to work with &GAP; 4.4.12 and earlier versions. The only 
limitation of this compatibility mode is that in the case of an 
error the break loop occurs on the server and can not be transmitted 
to the client (however, if the service consumer is the service provider 
in one person, then this is not as crucial as it might be in the general
case). After the &GAP; 4.5 release the package will fully be compatible 
with the official &GAP; releases.
<P/>

To use the &SCSCP; package it is necessary to install &GAP;4 packages
&IO; 3.0 <Cite Key="IO"/>, &GAPDoc; 1.2 <Cite Key="GAPDoc"/> 
and &OpenMath; 10.0.0 <Cite Key="openmath"/> or their newer versions.
<P/> 

The &SCSCP; package is distributed in standard formats (<File>tar.gz</File>, 
<File>tar.bz2</File>) and can be obtained from 
<URL>http://www.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/~alexk/scscp.htm</URL> or from the &GAP; 
web site (the latter also offers <File>zoo</File>- and <File>win.zip</File>-archives.
To unpack the <File>zoo</File>-archive the program <File>unzoo</File> is needed,
which can be obtained from the &GAP; homepage <URL>http://www.gap-system.org/</URL> 
(see section `Distribution'). To install &SCSCP; package, put its <File>zoo</File>-archive
into the <File>pkg</File> subdirectory of your &GAP;4.4 installation and 
enter the command <C>unzoo -x scscp-XXX.zoo</C>, then the subdirectory <File>scscp</File> 
(containing subdirectories <File>doc</File>, <File>lib</File> etc.) will be created in 
the <File>pkg</File> subdirectory. Installation using other archive formats is performed 
in a similar way.
<P/>

When there are no access rights to the root directory of the main &GAP; 
installation, it is also possible to install the package 
<E>outside the &GAP; main directory</E> by unpacking it inside a 
directory <File>MYGAPDIR/pkg</File>. Then to load &SCSCP; package 
&GAP; should be started with <C>-l ";MYGAPDIR"</C> option.
