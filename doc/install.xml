The &SCSCP; package is designed for &GAP;4.5 and no compatibility with 
previous releases of &GAP;4 is guaranteed. 
<P/>

To use The &SCSCP; package it is necessary to install &GAP;4 packages
&IO; <Cite Key="IO"/>, &GAPDoc; <Cite Key="GAPDoc"/> 
and (currently only development version of) &openmath; <Cite Key="openmath"/>.
<P/> 

The &SCSCP; package is distributed in standard formats
(<File>tar.gz</File>, <File>tar.bz2</File>, <File>-win.zip</File>) 
and can be obtained from <URL>http://www.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/~alexk/scscp.htm</URL>,
or <URL>http://www.symbolic-computation.org/</URL>, or
the page <URL>http://www.gap-system.org/Packages/packages.html</URL>
at the &GAP; web site. The latter also offers <File>zoo</File>-archive.
To unpack the archive <File>scscp-0.3.zoo</File> you need the program 
<File>unzoo</File>, which can be obtained from the &GAP; homepage 
<URL>http://www.gap-system.org/</URL> (see section `Distribution').
To install &SCSCP;, copy this archive into the <File>pkg</File> subdirectory of your 
&GAP;4.4 installation. The subdirectory <File>scscp</File> will be created in 
the <File>pkg</File> directory after the following command: 
<P/>
<C>unzoo -x scscp-0.3.zoo</C>
<P/>
When you don't have access to the directory of your main &GAP; 
installation, you can also install the package 
<E>outside the &GAP; main directory</E>
by unpacking it inside a directory <File>MYGAPDIR/pkg</File>. 
Then to be able to load &SCSCP; you need to call &GAP; with the 
<C>-l ";MYGAPDIR"</C> option.
<P/>
Installation using other archive formats is performed in a similar way.
