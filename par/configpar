# This file contains global variable SCSCPservers which
# specifies hosts and ports to search for SCSCP services.
#
# 1) To avoid errors, all services must have the called
#    SCSCP procedure installed and available under the
#    same name.
#
# 2) SCSCPservers is a proper GAP list, so you can use GAP
#    language constructions to generate it for a range
#    of port numbers.
#
# 3) It is better to arrange services in this list in a way
#    that faster services and services with shorter latency
#    will be located in the beginning of the list, this will
#    optimise the initial placement of tasks and will speed
#    up computation when the number of tasks is smaller than
#    the number of services.
#
